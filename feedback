Frankly speaking I didn't like to be trained  but this Techincal Bootcamp was designed in a way that it trained me by giving me enough freedom and assignments to work upon. It was even useful in clearing doubts of some basic things as well. Icing on the cake was the pluralsight which gave me freedom to learn whenever and wherever I want. I loved the overall experience and would recommend it for the future joinees.
